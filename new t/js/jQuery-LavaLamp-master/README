Awesome animated hover effects powered by jQuery (jquery.com) for your website menus.

Version: 1.4 

	new options:
		hoverStart, hoverFinish, returnStart, returnFinish - callbacks for different stages
			of the hover process.
		selectClass, homeClass, skipClass - optional overrides for internally used classes 
					'selectedLava', 'homeLava' and 'noLava'
	fixed:	 	improved check for skipClass (noLava) 
	enhanced:	lava animations now trigger on focusin and focusout to support keyboard usage

	thanks to:	MoOx for the customizable class and keyboard support suggestion
				many people who identified the noLava bug
